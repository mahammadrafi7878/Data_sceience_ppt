By maximizing the margin, SVM aims to achieve better generalization performance and improve the model's ability to classify unseen data accurately\n",

    "      A larger margin provides a wider separation between the classes, making the decision boundary more robust to noise and variability in the data. By incorporating a margin, SVM can tolerate some level of misclassification or uncertainties in the training data without compromising the model's performance.\n",

    "      Support vectors are the data points that are closest to the decision boundary or lie on the wrong side of the margin. These points play a crucial role in defining the decision boundary. The margin ensures that the decision boundary is determined by the support vectors, rather than being influenced by other data points. SVM focuses on optimizing the position of the decision boundary with respect to the support vectors, leading to a more effective classification.\n",
